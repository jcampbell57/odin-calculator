# odin-calculator

By the time I finish this project, I will have:

Implemented basic html and css styling to create a calculater interface
Implemented javascript logic to work the calculater including:
    - Working logic for all number, operation and modification inputs
    - event listeners for button clicks
    - keyboard support

This project could be improved with:
    - history of past operations stored on the side, perhaps in a collapsable container
    - Live preview on n1, operation, n2, and calculated value within input window. 
        - on the bottom right, greyed out, with regular display top left, black
